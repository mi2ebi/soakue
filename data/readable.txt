  robintown (2023-11-09): Etymology: Originally **ja**. **taı** was later added to avoid polysemy, which was further reduced to **aı**.

Prefix: lexicalizing modifier. Creates a new multi-word opaque vocabulary item out of the word this prefix attaches to and the word before it, with the semantic suggestion that the relationship between the two parts is similar to that invoked by the «be-» prefix

(2) It's possible to prevent a single event from happening but not preventing a different event from making the proposition true; e.g. you could prevent someone's death (by curing their disease), but then they die anyways (for unrelated reasons).

pronoun: cataphoric; a placeholder that anticipates an extra noun phrase after the clause
  fagri (2023-05-30): Example usage: «Ca có wä jaı jı́, wä gaı jı́ sá shuao de gu»
  uakci (2023-05-30): akin to **nä** (and as such termable as a cleft) except the extracted noun phrase appears after the clause, not before. we assume that this NP appears after all adverbials (i.e., a full clause, right below CP) and participates in a cleft structure that’s exactly like **nä** but not pronounced (we’re able to pull this off because we don’t need to disambiguate the end of a noun phrase from the start of a predicate)
  uakci (2023-05-30): in other words, if a **nä**-cleft looks like [vP (fronted subject) [v' [v nä] [CPrel with hóa]], then a **có**-cleft shall look like [vP [v' [CPrel with có] [v ∅]] (fronted subject)]

focus prefix: possibly X/perhaps X
  seaqtaq (2024-08-06): This is like daı as a focus prefix. Thus it has more permissive syntax. In simple cases, there appears to be no benefit, e.g. "Daı chuq náq zéo" ≈ "Chuq déom náq sá zeo". But in more complex ones, e.g. "Chuq líq rú déom náq", I believe the benefit is apparent in the rephrasing required with daı
  seaqtaq (2024-08-06): Haola déom X Y == Daı haola kú X Y

In addition to being less anthropocentric, it can be used for humans that can't speak as well.

  robintown (2021-08-01): This is the more regular form for modals.
  Laqme (2021-10-23): this expresses an obligation
  Laqme (2021-12-02): “deontic obligation”
  Laqme (2023-07-18): required
  Ilmen (2025-10-12): Why not a different word than the official ⟪duaı⟫? I interpret the original as having a focus on the person who is *reponsible* for the duty/obligation, and this new meaning doesn't allow expressing responsability.
  Ilmen (2025-10-12): Admittedly, the wording of the original definition is ambiguous and can also be interpreted as allowing ⟪the door ⟦duaı⟧/must be opened⟫ which is not about responsability. But I suspect this isn't what the original meaning is about, at least if we take into account the verb's frame.
  Ilmen (2025-10-12): I guess if this new definition were to be adopted, ⟪duaıgıla⟫ could work as a replacement for the previous meaning, but it's a bit longish…
  Dembim (2025-12-17): just fyi "A is obligated to bring about X" and "it is obligatory that A bring about X" are often considered interchangeable, at least in most cases. "Meinong-Chisholm reduction" I recall there being problems involving plural agents, but I'm not that familiar.
  Dembim (2026-02-04): Having looked into it a bit, I think the problems with impersonal obligation are rather serious. On the other hand, paraphrasing impersonal obligation in terms of an agent-indexed obligation operator alongside some gnomic/generic device seems likely (though I want to do more reading). So, I think <@official duaı> is the better definition, at least if we reconsider the class as ho rather than ta.

▯ feels / is doing/faring in a way exemplified with property ▯; ▯ satisfies property ▯, and this is reflective of their mood/disposition/state of mind/status in life/how they’re doing; ▯ is up to satisfying property ▯.
  uakci (2023-01-03): a much more useful redefinition of **foa** that doesn't artificially separate the mood-haver x1 from the mood property x2. if you're having trouble understanding this definition: it's like **ıq** but it says that this property is a mood or state that you're going through
  uakci (2023-01-03): notably, **foa gı** and **foa huı** now mean something else (sth like ‘being (morally?) good is my mood’) and you'll have to use **gıfoa**, **huıfoa** instead. but also it lets you say **foa nuokuaı** 'be in a state of mind of feeling sleepy', **foa doekaı** 'be down for some programming / be in the mood/zone for programming', etc.
  uakci (2023-03-12): some notes about the notes: (1) **foa bâq gı** also works; (2) since this **foa** is a hyponym of **ıq**, this implies that one who **foa doekaı**s is already one who **doekaı**s. you can say **foa taoshao sạdoekaı** for ‘feel like you’re down for some programming’, whose compositionality i like. i suppose that in this sense **foa** is just like **taq moe ıq**

  uakci (2023-11-01): note that not all compounds can use **gạ-** – only those which the speaker deems are a compound of two other existing lexical items can. so **marao** cannot be **rao gạkma** (unless the speaker really thinks that’s the etymology of **marao**. i don’t judge)
  uakci (2023-11-01): **rao gạma** (misspelling)

pendent particle: allows placing an argument in front and outside of a phrase in order to bind a variable within that phrase
  Hoemai (2025-03-07): Originally I thought that this would just be an empty preposition and therefore precede its complement. But this would require a change to the rules governing adjunct placement and scope, because pendent constructions often appear between subject and object (see examples below), and it would also limit its application.
  Hoemai (2025-03-07): I also seem to prefer the feel of **gâ** as a postposition. Given these points, I propose that **gâ** be like a barnacle.
  Hoemai (2025-03-07): Like a barnacle, it sits on top of whatever (phrase) is right next to it; its host is actually its complement, and the pendent argument itself is the specifier.
  Hoemai (2025-03-07): Example usage: **Shoe jí, sía raı gâ, ꝡä kuq súq ráı.** "I allow, for no X, that you say X." **Dua jí, sá poq gâ, ꝡä cho hó súq.** "I know, of someone, that they like you."

  uakci (2026-02-17): given the usual mathematical treatment of relations as subsets of U × U (where U is the domain/universe), this **guoı** expresses membership modulo ordering: “the unordered tuple {a, b} for a ≠ b is s.t. aRb or bRa”

  maigoi (2024-09-17): that tells me 'loves what is different', could as well be a xenophile or someone who likes to explore new, different things than they already know
  maigoi (2024-09-18): there should be a shorter root for ( ) is 'romantically' & 'sexually' 'attracted' to ( ) for use instead of mai
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18): Hi!  I personally think this word is fine as is because the word “gay” for example, could mean that someone is homoromantic or homosexual.  There can also exist less specific words.  Of course, more specific words are always welcome, but I think most people would rather say “I am straight” than “I am heteroromantic and heterosexual.”
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18): As for your note that this word doesn’t mention gender anywhere, the alternative would be heojeqda[mai/romantic-attract/sexual-attract]. You could think of this word as an shortening of that word. Additionally, Toaq compounds are not always just their parts combined. For example, choıshoaı means hawk, but it is a compound word “sharp-wing”
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18): Oh, and @maigoi, the word **heoseaq** exists for heterosexual.
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18): Additionally, you are free to coin new words as you like.  Most words in Toaq are created by the community based on need.  For example, this word was coined by @fagri, not Hoemai (the creator of Toaq).  So you are more than welcome to create a word for heteromantic :)
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18): You can join us on our Discord server https://discord.gg/Wxn6XF4G to discuss coining words.
  maigoi (2024-09-22): hello! I like non-specifity! I just mean the word is indeed nice, but evokes a broader meaning than specifically heterosexuality :)

I think the definition itself could be more... interesting;

now, I don't think there would need to be a compound of three roots, just a new root for the two of them which are very common!

I have no creativity for creating roots and I made a toki pona words generator, not a Toaq one so, I'm unlucky now xD

I like how the community creates its own words, but I'm seeing my way into Toaq for pure aesthetics, and I highly consider grammar (thus learning a logical language) and well-made compounds (so it doesn't make the grammar useless as 'logical'). those factors are important to me, as I wouldn't a logical language being harder to parse than toki pona, due to... autistic reasons ._.

I don't use Discord but suspect this is bridged;

have a nice day!
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-22): We also have a Matrix space, if you use that https://matrix.to/#/#toaq:robin.town :D    if not, that’s okay too
  mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-22): The matrix space could really use some activity, lol
  TheAndSys (2024-09-22): Yeah man, is there any other chat you use? There's a lot of discussion around the language that happens beyond just this dictionary!
  idontremembermypassword (2024-11-15): uh, I don't use chat apps, I'm very offline-ish as internet goes nowdays... I wouldn't really like to use unencrypted, spionaged, nor untrusty software in general... my goals from internet is extraction and real life use, it's possible that I may grow an Esperanto, toki pona, lojban or Toaq Gufujo one day... I guess it doesn't make sense to interact with the Toaq dictionary then, I can make a generator for that

Another, less good example, is what a teacher would say about a gifted kid.

▯ calculates ▯ [see notes].
  uakci (2021-11-06): this is a reformulation of <@official jıoq> that avoids depending on properties as answer-givers. x₂ may be filled with a proposition or an indirect question
  uakci (2021-11-06): if x₂ is a (non-interrogative) proposition, the verb means “to calculate that x₂ is the case”; “to come to the conclusion that x₂ is the case through calculation/reckoning”
  uakci (2021-11-06): ex.: **jıoq jí pêu péı jo péı gu péı gu** – ‘I calculate that 2 + 2 = 4’
  uakci (2021-11-06): this form may be used in a serial (**jıoq peu jí péı jo péı gu péı gu** = the same); moreover, you can say **jıoq peu jí** ‘I add’ (I calculate addition operations)
  uakci (2021-11-06): if x₂ is a polar interrogative proposition (one with **ma**), this verb means “to verify if x₂ is the case”. x₂ is not asserted
  uakci (2021-11-06): if x₂ is an interrogative proposition involving **tıo**, **co**, **hı**, this verb can be translated like the official definition – x₁ calculates what the answer to x₂ is

prefix: turn verb into focus prefix
  uakci (2023-10-13): see **meq**, **kueu**. the mechanics of this word goes as follows: •if X is binary, then the focus prefix feeds the focused part of a proposition as the first argument and the ‘remainder’ expressed as a lambda as the second argument. for example, **cho jí mẹ́qsoq súq** transforms into **soq súq, lä cho jí já**. in this vein, **mẹ́q'ıq** corresponds to the no-op focus prefix. note that the original preposition is lifted, i.e., no longer asserted (in favor of the ancillary proposition whose predicate is X); •if X is unary, then the use of the focus prefix is equivalent to an adjoined clause with it replaced by **kú** – for example, **cho jí mẹ́qgıfaq súq** transforms into **cho jí súq; gıfaq, ꝡä cho jî kú súq**. note that this use is essentially similar to an eventive adverb (here, **gîfaq**), so like a focused/scoped adverbial if you will

meq @Ilmen 2020-01-10 #RSxfBglvT $en +1
quantifier: the proposition in which this quantifier appears is treated as a property with a lambda slot placed exactly where this quantifier appears; the resulting property is then claimed to satisfy the first slot of the predicate introduced by this quantifier.

  Ilmen (2020-01-14): ``meq hảo`` is similar to ``hão`` but instead of delivering a proposition (lû) to the first slot of ``hao`` as is the case with the latter, it passes a property (lî) to it. Compare ``chỏq jí ní jẽaq dảqfāı`` —"I use this increasingly frequently"— with ``chỏq meq pủıjēaq ní`` —"increasingly many ones use this"—.
  Ilmen (2020-01-14): What can be expressed as ``gủaı meq dùq póq`` under the alternative definition #46CV57Aje can be expressed as per this very definition as ``gủaı póq ru meq hỏpā dủq``, which is three syllables more. Hopefully the additional flexibility allowed by this one definition is a sufficient compensation.

prefix: Names or refers to a variable like **nha-**, but otherwise behaves like the verb on its own, including variable binding.
  Neaqbua (2024-10-02): 	For example, when you say ‹nhú-kune› for the first time (or ‹**nhúaı-**kune›), it binds ‹kúne›, ‹hó›, and ‹nhú-kune›. Then, saying ‹nhú-kune› will bring up the original referent, which again binds ‹kúne› and ‹hó›.
  Neaqbua (2024-10-02): 	Intuitively, ‹nhú-kune› is read as "a dog that will remain relevant for a while" or "that dog from before."
  Neaqbua (2024-10-02): 	‹nhu-X› can only be rebound by ‹**nhuaı-**X›. For clarity in long texts, you can introduce new ‹nhu-X› bindings always with ‹**nhuaı**-X›.
  Neaqbua (2024-10-02): 	In contrast to **nha-**, the verb is not arbitrary: ‹nhú-raımı›, like ‹ráımı›, is restricted by the "raımı(_)" predicate.

  Laqme (2019-01-25): Some context: I wanted something fun and slangy-sounding and easy to say, and more {ie'o}-like and {sa'enai}-like than literally “similar to / approximate to having such-and-such-property”.  You can throw it anywhere as an adverbial interjection («rãrā») and it also works well in serials («rárā chủe»). This is apriori-ish, but duplicating the word for “or” seemed fitting, because that’s what a few languages I speak do, at least.

  fagri (2019-11-30): Should this be used with two (1) types? As with "Rỉoq lî kảtō na lî nỉaı da"? In this version, it would essentially be saying that the first property is a "subset" of the second one.

prefix: turn verb X into verb: ▯ is in a state resulting from having X’d.
  uakci (2023-10-25): this is slightly different from **luı** because it emphasizes the new state, this state being the end result of the action, rather than the action itself. it implies that some change was made and the subject is persisting that change

  Ilmen (2026-02-17): In the past I called this “null illocution”, though I think “contemplative illocution” is nice too.
  Ilmen (2026-02-17): You could presumably imitate this by saying e.g. ⟪sıaja, ꝡä …… da⟫ instead of ⟪…… so'u⟫.
  Ilmen (2026-02-17): At any rate, theoretically, this could be used to replace subordinate clauses with flat sequences of sentences, using pro-sentence anaphora ⟪hóq⟫ instead of subordinate clauses. But I think for it to really be handy and powerful enough, you'd need ways to refer to sentences that are not immediately before the current one, possibly with some sort of device akin to Lojban ⟪go'oi⟫…

▯ satisfies property ▯ the most.
  uakci (2022-01-09): this definition works flawlessly despite serial right-branching – e.g., **soq hủı pỏq** ‘the worst person’, **nı sỏq chủı tỉsha nỉ** ‘the first two to arrive here’
  uakci (2022-01-09): actually, »despite« isn’t even the right word here. the complement of a **soq** serial can be attributive or predicative. if it’s predicative (say, A B), then **soq** sees the property of satisfying A the most (while also being B); if attributive, we still get valid semantics for things like **nuı kảnı** ‘small rabbit’, since the **nuı**-est **kảnı** is also the **nuı**-est thing that is also a **kanı**
  uakci (2022-01-09): in other words, since the extent of an adjectival serial A B is proportional to the extent of A and not A × B (barring situations where B is flat-out false), **soq** will look at the correct »part« of the serial
  uakci (2022-01-09): yet another way to look at it: in an adjectival serial such as A B, the A part is qualitative (how *much* something is A), whereas the B part is quantitative (*if* that thing is B *at all*). so rather than A × B we have something like the *truth value* of B times the *extent* of Aa
  uakci (2022-01-09): if you agree with these postulates, you'll find this definition of **soq** unobjectionable
  uakci (2022-01-09): CORRECTION: the example beginning in **nı sỏq chủı…** should read **gu sỏq chủı…** instead
  el (2022-01-11): this definition also works very well with **meabı**, and that means **suı** can be defined similar to this

  uakci (2023-01-21): extending hoemaı's analysis of english focus adverbs such as 'only' and 'even', which actually pair with sentence-level stress-based focus, we can see that 'the most' works similarly: '*I* like apples the most' (more than other people) vs. 'I like *apples* the most' (more than I do other fruit/food). **soq** used to be really inconvenient in convoluted situations and usually required a confusing **lu** clause to work at all, whereas this approach should feel much more natural
  uakci (2023-01-21): see also 'prior work': **sojı** (which is a RU)

▯ is a member of the superorder Dinosauria (the true dinosaurs).
  Hoemai (2019-04-01): "Dinosaur" is from Ancient Greek δεινός (“terrible, fearful”) + σαῦρος (“lizard”), which is an alternative form of σαύρᾱ. δεινός (from PIE *dwey- (“fear”)) sounds like and is close in meaning to **tea**, while **saorā** sounds like σαύρᾱ but also happens to includes **sao**, which means "large", which is very fitting for dinosaurs. This compound is thus a lucky coincidence on two levels.

I'm happy that you're here.
  robintown (2023-10-30): Lynn and I had a discussion about this, where we concluded that neither **kûı** or **gêm** really make sense for this meaning. As adjuncts, both constructions imply that you are, on the whole, happy. But imagine a situation in which you're having a bad day, and a friend comes to comfort you: you might say "I'm happy that you're here" even if it wouldn't be genuine to say "I'm happy". We found a paper https://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/DIzYWZkM/clauses.doc which claims that the clausal constituent participates in the semantics by a "regarding" relation, which suggests that a topic is the appropriate construction in Toaq. And there's similar evidence in Japanese to support this.

  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Damned “remove” button
  kazoo (2025-11-09): why not bridge the matrix server
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): I think the ^ tone semantics assume ë instead of ꝡä
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): But I think it's fine to allow for ꝡä
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Probably depending on the type of the verb on which ^ is put
  kazoo (2025-11-09): makes sense
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): The ꝡä semantics are needed for using stuff like ⟪guo⟫ and ⟪le⟫ as adverbs
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): And I even suspect this also applies to stuff like ⟪ca⟫ and ⟪rao⟫
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Alternatively, it could be that the meaning of “event” is more abstract that what I supposed thus far, in such a way that the ë-ꝡä distinction wouldn't really be meaningful…
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Besides Matrix, we could also use GitHub Discussion (i.e. GitHub forums)
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Any repository can have a GitHub Discussion attached to it
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): I don't know whether the GitHub notification bot that relays Issues message would also relay stuff from Discussions
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Oh there's also the Conlangs From Space forum
  kazoo (2025-11-09): iirc wä is a subset of ë where the speaker also claims the event happened. am i recalling correctly?
  evie (2025-11-09): no
  kazoo (2025-11-09): also i wonder if shu includes the tone or does it just quote the root
  evie (2025-11-09): wa is 'the (fact/proposition/statement) that'
  evie (2025-11-09): shu does not steal tone. shu rao, shu jí, shu wä, shu nîe
  evie (2025-11-09): shú whatever / ké shu whatever turns it into a noun
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i know but i mean is shú rao the same as shú ráo
  evie (2025-11-09): no
  kazoo (2025-11-09): then what is the fundamental difference between an event of... and a fact of...
  kazoo (2025-11-09): (unrelated to shu)
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): A proposition is abstract, it contains only the information that is given in it and nothing more; a proposition can entail any less detailed version of it (“a tall man wears a blue hat” → “a man wears a hat”), and any more detailed proposition similarly entails the first one, forming a hierarchy of level of detailedness / amount of information.
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): The way I understand events is that they are individual entities, presumably spatiotemporal entities but I think it's possible to extend them to non-spationtempral worlds (so that “an event of 1 = √1” would make sense)
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): It is possible to conceive individuals and propositions as belonging to a single supertype, in such a way that an individual is an infinitely or maximally detailed proposition, so that, unlike standard proposition, an event cannot entail or be instantiated by a “more detailed event”
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): So that it would be like a terminal node in the hierarchy of abstractness/detailedness
  kazoo (2025-11-09): 
  kazoo (2025-11-09): 
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i keep hitting the enter button
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): As a side note, ⟪ꝡä⟫ and ⟪báq ë⟫ could possibly be equivalent in effect
  kazoo (2025-11-09): :thinking emoji:
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): But I'm not sure, the semantics of ⟪báq⟫ seem to have changed in Kúna, and I've not yet studied new-báq…
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Anyway, people say that tone ^ is associated with events, but this might clash with my theory of “events are indiviuals reifying propositions”
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): I've started to doubt that verbs like ⟦ca⟧ deal with individual events instead of propositions
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): When you say ⟪pushing this button causes the door to open⟫, you're not thinking of a specific fully detailed and concrete event of pushing the button
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): If you did, we wouldn't know whether the real cause would be unspoken details about the event
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): But with an adverb like ⟪de⟫, you do want to talk about unspoken details
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): ⟪he danced funnily⟫ means that some unspoken details of a concrete event instantiating ⟪he dances⟫ are funny
  evie (2025-11-09): yea i think shê works better there. shê wá someone pushes the button nä the door opens
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): it's not just the abstract idea that he dances that is funny
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Maybe we could also say that ⟪dê⟫ is actually not good and that we should use ⟪châ sá de⟫
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Or we could say that ⟪de⟫'s type require an individual, concrete reading, unlike e.g. ⟪ca⟫
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): *requires
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): It's not just ⟪ca⟫, imagine also ⟪boq⟫
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): I suspect more predicates that we might expect actually expect abstract, non-concrete events (i.e. propositions)
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i wonder what the wa - wä pair for ë would even be
  evie (2025-11-09): e is hardly ever used as the main verb of a sentence
  kazoo (2025-11-09): or if it would even make sense
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Well, speech acts are typically about ꝡä or embedded questions, not about concrete event arguments
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Oh I tend to forget ⟪é⟫ isn't a (regular) complementizer like ꝡa
  kazoo (2025-11-09): unrelatedly, ive been working on a new language whose grammar could be considered improved toaq gamma with a hint of delta proposals
  kazoo (2025-11-09): a lot of my langs lately have been coincidentally similar to toaq so i've decided to embrace the toaqness now
  kazoo (2025-11-09): it takes some surface-level inspiration with other sinitic languages with its phonology
  kazoo (2025-11-09): it only has ë and lä clauses as complementizers and the other clause "type"s are constructed by just attaching it to a noun as a plain ol ~adjective
  kazoo (2025-11-09): so that it can be more flexible
  kazoo (2025-11-09): (c.f. 300 different NU particles of lojban)
  kazoo (2025-11-09): it tries to bring the "everything is a predicate" even further
  kazoo (2025-11-09): compared to toaq im planning to make it basically like loglan vs lojban except its a coexisting fun alternative rather than an improvement
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i think toaq as it is is already cool, i just like to make stuff that would keep the level of coolness
  kazoo (2025-11-09): it also primarily switches to monadic second-(/higher?-)order logic which is expressively the same as plural logic but uses sets which is more intuitive to me
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Nothing wrong with making new Toaq-inspired languages :')
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): You can have modified sets… You probably don't want empty sets in the way, do you?
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): On the other hand, nested sets may be useful
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Some forms of Plural Logic allows for nested plurals, but with important constrants
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): E.g. you can have the equivalent of {{A, B}, {C, D}}, but not {{A, B}, C, D}
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): And the former is not of the same type as {A, B}
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): (first-order plural vs second-order plural, basically)
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i see
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i also briefly considered abolishing the universal quantifier by using a special object incorporation construction, basically resulting as "there is a set that has an instance of all humans; which satisfies aliveness"
  kazoo (2025-11-09): but i do not know if this would work for all instances of universal quantification
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): With empty sets allowed, and saying that each member of the set individually has the property, then it works for a singular universal quantifier
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Eberban doesn't have quantifiers and use predicates instead
  kazoo (2025-11-09): yeah im just gonna make it sá by default and make the rest with predicates
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i decided that because i randomly remembered once that the wiki says to append shı to the argument to mimic singularity and i thought "why is this not made for every determiner??"
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): There used to be ⟪túshı⟫ at one point in the past
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): But it was decided that it was more frequently used than plural universal, so ⟪túshı⟫'s meaning was transposed over ⟪tú⟫
  kazoo (2025-11-09): thats a little bit funny lol, the newer concept being swapped with the normal one
  kazoo (2025-11-09): tho i meant that every determiner should instead be a predicate
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Have you looked into my Yaıgawe? All quantifiers are derived from verbs with a “quantifierizer” suffix.
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Nahaıwa can do that too, but it has morphological shorthand for some common determiners
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): As for what is the unmarked default quantifier for them… Originally my idea was that the default would be lowest-scope existential quantification, but now I'm considering the possibility to have the default be a báq-like intension (i.e. not necessarily referring to a concrete individual)
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): So that ⟪beautiful-V dog-NOM⟫ would mean ⟪dogness is beautiful⟫ rather than ⟪there exist a beautiful dog⟫
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Hmm maybe this should depend on modality too
  Ilmen (2025-11-09): Oh, don't forget the anaphoric determiner, Toaq's raising tone, which can't quite be rendered as a predicate
  kazoo (2025-11-09): hm, maybe i could handle it by just offering hu/ke options or using back-referring pronouns
  kazoo (2025-11-09): if i (la'anai) manage to not use up most of the tones i have added to the phonology i could use one for that
  kazoo (2025-11-09): currently have like 6 or 7 of them
  kazoo (2025-11-09): i have found use for 5 of them currently
