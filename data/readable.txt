▯ gets ▯ to satisfy property ▯.
robintown (2023-11-09T19:36:24.462Z): Etymology: Originally **ja**. **taı** was later added to avoid polysemy, which was further reduced to **aı**.
robintown (2023-11-09T20:14:27.808Z): In colloquial speech, this word still commonly takes the form of 'ja' in serial verbs, but only in the falling tone.
robintown (2023-11-25T18:37:11.883Z): Compared to **tua**, this word has the additional semantic nuance of enticing or helping another agent to enter some state.

Prefix: lexicalizing modifier. Creates a new multi-word opaque vocabulary item out of the word this prefix attaches to and the word before it, with the semantic suggestion that the relationship between the two parts is similar to that invoked by the «be-» prefix
fagri (2023-01-06T03:36:50.423Z): Example: The term «budo ba-hıao» ("noodle of harm") could be defined as an informal synonym for "snake"
fagri (2023-01-06T03:41:52.797Z): Another example: the terms "malum prohibitum" and "malum in se" could be calqued into Toaq as «huı ba-juao» and «huı ba-huı»
fagri (2023-01-06T03:45:42.991Z): The relationship can also be the one invoked by the «ce-» prefix

Isi (2024-09-08T13:08:37.805Z): The idea behind these slots being this way: (1) I feel that there's not a big difference between a proposition or event preventing something from happening vs. a thing preventing it from happening. (2) It's possible to prevent a single event from happening but not preventing a different event from making the proposition true; e.g. you could prevent someone's death (by curing their disease), but then they die anyways (for unrelated reasons).
Isi (2024-09-08T13:08:43.452Z): Though I'm not sure if the semantics make sense when you refer to an event that doesn't actually happen.

focus prefix: possibly X/perhaps X
seaqtaq (2024-08-06T01:29:30.310Z): This is like daı as a focus prefix. Thus it has more permissive syntax. In simple cases, there appears to be no benefit, e.g. "Daı chuq náq zéo" ≈ "Chuq déom náq sá zeo". But in more complex ones, e.g. "Chuq líq rú déom náq", I believe the benefit is apparent in the rephrasing required with daı
seaqtaq (2024-08-06T01:33:44.672Z): Haola déom X Y == Daı haola kú X Y
seaqtaq (2024-08-06T01:37:38.408Z): Ergo "Chuq líq rú déom náq sá zéo" == "Chuq líq sá zeo rú daı chuq kú náq sá zeo"

Ilmen (2025-10-12T19:52:04.339Z): Why not a different word than the official ⟪duaı⟫? I interpret the original as having a focus on the person who is *reponsible* for the duty/obligation, and this new meaning doesn't allow expressing responsability.
Ilmen (2025-10-12T19:54:08.395Z): Admittedly, the wording of the original definition is ambiguous and can also be interpreted as allowing ⟪the door ⟦duaı⟧/must be opened⟫ which is not about responsability. But I suspect this isn't what the original meaning is about, at least if we take into account the verb's frame.
Ilmen (2025-10-12T19:55:40.572Z): I guess if this new definition were to be adopted, ⟪duaıgıla⟫ could work as a replacement for the previous meaning, but it's a bit longish…

▯ feels / is doing/faring in a way exemplified with property ▯; ▯ satisfies property ▯, and this is reflective of their mood/disposition/state of mind/status in life/how they’re doing; ▯ is up to satisfying property ▯.
uakci (2023-01-03T10:54:21.582Z): a much more useful redefinition of **foa** that doesn't artificially separate the mood-haver x1 from the mood property x2. if you're having trouble understanding this definition: it's like **ıq** but it says that this property is a mood or state that you're going through
uakci (2023-01-03T10:56:02.413Z): notably, **foa gı** and **foa huı** now mean something else (sth like ‘being (morally?) good is my mood’) and you'll have to use **gıfoa**, **huıfoa** instead. but also it lets you say **foa nuokuaı** 'be in a state of mind of feeling sleepy', **foa doekaı** 'be down for some programming / be in the mood/zone for programming', etc.
uakci (2023-03-12T09:29:42.605Z): some notes about the notes: (1) **foa bâq gı** also works; (2) since this **foa** is a hyponym of **ıq**, this implies that one who **foa doekaı**s is already one who **doekaı**s. you can say **foa taoshao sạdoekaı** for ‘feel like you’re down for some programming’, whose compositionality i like. i suppose that in this sense **foa** is just like **taq moe ıq**

pendent particle: allows placing an argument in front and outside of a phrase in order to bind a variable within that phrase
Hoemai (2025-03-07T14:42:37.268Z): Originally I thought that this would just be an empty preposition and therefore precede its complement. But this would require a change to the rules governing adjunct placement and scope, because pendent constructions often appear between subject and object (see examples below), and it would also limit its application.
Hoemai (2025-03-07T14:42:45.454Z): I also seem to prefer the feel of **gâ** as a postposition. Given these points, I propose that **gâ** be like a barnacle.
Hoemai (2025-03-07T14:42:51.655Z): Like a barnacle, it sits on top of whatever (phrase) is right next to it; its host is actually its complement, and the pendent argument itself is the specifier.
Hoemai (2025-03-07T14:43:08.671Z): Example usage: **Shoe jí, sía raı gâ, ꝡä kuq súq ráı.** "I allow, for no X, that you say X." **Dua jí, sá poq gâ, ꝡä cho hó súq.** "I know, of someone, that they like you."

mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18T06:25:32.167Z): Hi!  I personally think this word is fine as is because the word “gay” for example, could mean that someone is homoromantic or homosexual.  There can also exist less specific words.  Of course, more specific words are always welcome, but I think most people would rather say “I am straight” than “I am heteroromantic and heterosexual.”
mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18T06:30:18.250Z): As for your note that this word doesn’t mention gender anywhere, the alternative would be heojeqda[mai/romantic-attract/sexual-attract]. You could think of this word as an shortening of that word. Additionally, Toaq compounds are not always just their parts combined. For example, choıshoaı means hawk, but it is a compound word “sharp-wing”
mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18T06:31:25.218Z): Oh, and @maigoi, the word **heoseaq** exists for heterosexual.
mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18T06:34:50.334Z): Additionally, you are free to coin new words as you like.  Most words in Toaq are created by the community based on need.  For example, this word was coined by @fagri, not Hoemai (the creator of Toaq).  So you are more than welcome to create a word for heteromantic :)
mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-18T07:02:51.624Z): You can join us on our Discord server https://discord.gg/Wxn6XF4G to discuss coining words.
maigoi (2024-09-22T14:33:53.273Z): hello! I like non-specifity! I just mean the word is indeed nice, but evokes a broader meaning than specifically heterosexuality :)

I think the definition itself could be more... interesting;

now, I don't think there would need to be a compound of three roots, just a new root for the two of them which are very common!

I have no creativity for creating roots and I made a toki pona words generator, not a Toaq one so, I'm unlucky now xD

I like how the community creates its own words, but I'm seeing my way into Toaq for pure aesthetics, and I highly consider grammar (thus learning a logical language) and well-made compounds (so it doesn't make the grammar useless as 'logical'). those factors are important to me, as I wouldn't a logical language being harder to parse than toki pona, due to... autistic reasons ._.

I don't use Discord but suspect this is bridged;

have a nice day!
mimiaoganhaqpy (2024-09-22T16:10:06.952Z): We also have a Matrix space, if you use that https://matrix.to/#/#toaq:robin.town :D    if not, that’s okay too

TheAndSys (2024-09-22T17:11:34.596Z): Yeah man, is there any other chat you use? There's a lot of discussion around the language that happens beyond just this dictionary!
idontremembermypassword (2024-11-15T00:30:09.305Z): uh, I don't use chat apps, I'm very offline-ish as internet goes nowdays... I wouldn't really like to use unencrypted, spionaged, nor untrusty software in general... my goals from internet is extraction and real life use, it's possible that I may grow an Esperanto, toki pona, lojban or Toaq Gufujo one day... I guess it doesn't make sense to interact with the Toaq dictionary then, I can make a generator for that

 ▯, as a member of a group sharing a contextually significanty property (whether it be ideology, religion, ethnic group, sports team preference, etc.), becomes wary/apprehensive upon a perceived outsider of said group joining in ongoing derision/criticism commonly held by typical members of said group due to being in said group—oftentimes of the group itself, but not always—being discussed by the group, where the perceived outsider joins in on the derision for a wholly different reason, as they don't share the contextually significant property

uakci (2021-11-06T21:00:17.906Z): this is a reformulation of <@official jıoq> that avoids depending on properties as answer-givers. x₂ may be filled with a proposition or an indirect question
uakci (2021-11-06T21:00:57.132Z): if x₂ is a (non-interrogative) proposition, the verb means “to calculate that x₂ is the case”; “to come to the conclusion that x₂ is the case through calculation/reckoning”
uakci (2021-11-06T21:01:45.313Z): ex.: **jıoq jí pêu péı jo péı gu péı gu** – ‘I calculate that 2 + 2 = 4’
uakci (2021-11-06T21:02:27.755Z): this form may be used in a serial (**jıoq peu jí péı jo péı gu péı gu** = the same); moreover, you can say **jıoq peu jí** ‘I add’ (I calculate addition operations)
uakci (2021-11-06T21:03:00.201Z): if x₂ is a polar interrogative proposition (one with **ma**), this verb means “to verify if x₂ is the case”. x₂ is not asserted
uakci (2021-11-06T21:03:34.381Z): if x₂ is an interrogative proposition involving **tıo**, **co**, **hı**, this verb can be translated like the official definition – x₁ calculates what the answer to x₂ is

▯ is a metaphor / allegory / symbolism for "inner meaning" ▯.
Laqme (2021-10-18T12:05:58.457Z): This is 0 0, and the sense is a bit literary: "the picture frame being cracked is a metaphor for the couple having broken up". But I think this is also fine for when things happen to be aptly symbolic for other things by sheer coincidence, without being "written" into existence (only interpreted into existence).

robintown (2023-11-07T17:38:41.709Z): Etymology: Compared to **leuq** this is a considerably more modern term, designed to read as 'LGTBQ' in Derani. Alternatively, a common folk etymology tells that it was formed from a reduced form of **leuq** + **túq**.
uakci (2023-11-07T17:47:53.704Z): another folk etymology could state that **lotuq** < **lo** + **tuq**, or ◌́+ **tuq**, or **túq**

prefix: turn verb into focus prefix
uakci (2023-10-13T09:38:53.112Z): see **meq**, **kueu**. the mechanics of this word goes as follows: •if X is binary, then the focus prefix feeds the focused part of a proposition as the first argument and the ‘remainder’ expressed as a lambda as the second argument. for example, **cho jí mẹ́qsoq súq** transforms into **soq súq, lä cho jí já**. in this vein, **mẹ́q'ıq** corresponds to the no-op focus prefix. note that the original preposition is lifted, i.e., no longer asserted (in favor of the ancillary proposition whose predicate is X); •if X is unary, then the use of the focus prefix is equivalent to an adjoined clause with it replaced by **kú** – for example, **cho jí mẹ́qgıfaq súq** transforms into **cho jí súq; gıfaq, ꝡä cho jî kú súq**. note that this use is essentially similar to an eventive adverb (here, **gîfaq**), so like a focused/scoped adverbial if you will

quantifier: the proposition in which this quantifier appears is treated as a property with a lambda slot placed exactly where this quantifier appears; the resulting property is then claimed to satisfy the first slot of the predicate introduced by this quantifier.
Ilmen (2020-01-10T22:21:45.283Z): ``mủıdūa meq nỏa ní`` = ``nỏa mûıdūa ja ní``.
Ilmen (2020-01-14T17:13:28.836Z): ``meq hảo`` is similar to ``hão`` but instead of delivering a proposition (lû) to the first slot of ``hao`` as is the case with the latter, it passes a property (lî) to it. Compare ``chỏq jí ní jẽaq dảqfāı`` —"I use this increasingly frequently"— with ``chỏq meq pủıjēaq ní`` —"increasingly many ones use this"—.
Ilmen (2020-01-14T17:13:41.081Z): What can be expressed as ``gủaı meq dùq póq`` under the alternative definition #46CV57Aje can be expressed as per this very definition as ``gủaı póq ru meq hỏpā dủq``, which is three syllables more.

weyzerto (2023-07-26T16:24:04.890Z): ocean and sea are different meanings.  I really request to split this into two words as it cannot be made into one word as it is confusing.

uakci (2022-06-20T08:04:03.842Z): apt for the entire range of sound-symbolic vocabulary out there (from phonomime to phenomime to psychomime); can be used to borrow mimetic vocabulary from other languages on the spot; also intended to be used with interjections, as in **mımoe oro** ‘to be like ugh’ ≈ ‘to be (visibly) exasperated’
uakci (2022-06-20T08:07:10.326Z): this particle is in SHU and thus accepts one word of any form
uakci (2022-06-20T08:08:28.231Z): etymology: ‘mimetic’ + **moe**. i guess you could say it’s **mı** + **moe** too, same difference
uakci (2022-06-20T09:18:37.993Z): the word was at first intended to be able to capture and reuse interjections as verbs (as in, to be able to say things like “he ughed”), but on second thoughts it turned out to be much more versatile than that
uakci (2022-06-20T09:19:15.325Z): ≈ **aı shủ …**, **aı mỏ … teo** but more on-point and cuter

prefix: Names or refers to a variable like **nha-**, but otherwise behaves like the verb on its own, including variable binding.
Neaqbua (2024-10-02T01:23:42.113Z): 	For example, when you say ‹nhú-kune› for the first time (or ‹**nhúaı-**kune›), it binds ‹kúne›, ‹hó›, and ‹nhú-kune›. Then, saying ‹nhú-kune› will bring up the original referent, which again binds ‹kúne› and ‹hó›.
Neaqbua (2024-10-02T01:24:02.080Z): 	Intuitively, ‹nhú-kune› is read as "a dog that will remain relevant for a while" or "that dog from before."
Neaqbua (2024-10-02T01:24:13.853Z): 	‹nhu-X› can only be rebound by ‹**nhuaı-**X›. For clarity in long texts, you can introduce new ‹nhu-X› bindings always with ‹**nhuaı**-X›.
Neaqbua (2024-10-02T01:24:23.609Z): 	In contrast to **nha-**, the verb is not arbitrary: ‹nhú-raımı›, like ‹ráımı›, is restricted by the "raımı(_)" predicate.

fagri (2019-11-30T02:51:42.617Z): Should this be used with two (1) types? As with "Rỉoq lî kảtō na lî nỉaı da"? In this version, it would essentially be saying that the first property is a "subset" of the second one.
fagri (2019-11-30T02:53:55.766Z): The Toaq version would be: "Mẻa lú jẻo hóa ráı[1] na lú jẻo hóa ráı[2]"
uakci (2022-06-05T07:58:26.137Z): this word is perhaps best understood as a kind predicate (now that we have kinds, it’s only natural!), so e.g., **rỉoq baq kủochaı baq chảı** for ‘black tea is a kind of tea’. for properties, you may use **lıca**. for concretes, you may use **mea**
uakci (2022-11-01T17:26:41.898Z): perhaps more interestingly we could regard this predicate as being an implication operator over kinds: ∀X. lo(x₁)(X) → lo(x₂)(X). see **lo**

prefix: turn verb X into verb: ▯ is in a state resulting from having X’d.
uakci (2023-10-25T11:07:25.347Z): this is slightly different from **luı** because it emphasizes the new state, this state being the end result of the action, rather than the action itself. it implies that some change was made and the subject is persisting that change
uakci (2023-10-25T11:08:17.221Z): you could also perhaps argue that a closed door *is* **luı rıasho** or **tẹrıatua** although that is petty and not up-to-speed with pragmatics and **mala** exists for that semantic space already anyway
uakci (2023-10-25T11:08:44.986Z): so perhaps this is reminiscent of the german zustandspassiv (‘is opened’ as opposed to ‘has opened’)

Laqme (2025-03-20T14:51:57.998Z): A **sema** is, under the hood, a function from worlds to plural constants. In kuna, this is the most basic denotation of an **aqmı**. For example, **túq gochıq** more or less denotes a **sema** that selects all cats from the world.
Laqme (2025-03-20T14:53:45.639Z): This concept is worthy of some primacy because the "environment of bound pronouns" can be thought of as a mapping from pronouns to **sema**-s.

▯ satisfies property ▯ the most.
uakci (2022-01-09T14:45:47.458Z): this definition works flawlessly despite serial right-branching – e.g., **soq hủı pỏq** ‘the worst person’, **nı sỏq chủı tỉsha nỉ** ‘the first two to arrive here’
uakci (2022-01-09T14:49:46.970Z): actually, »despite« isn’t even the right word here. the complement of a **soq** serial can be attributive or predicative. if it’s predicative (say, A B), then **soq** sees the property of satisfying A the most (while also being B); if attributive, we still get valid semantics for things like **nuı kảnı** ‘small rabbit’, since the **nuı**-est **kảnı** is also the **nuı**-est thing that is also a **kanı**
uakci (2022-01-09T14:51:14.748Z): in other words, since the extent of an adjectival serial A B is proportional to the extent of A and not A × B (barring situations where B is flat-out false), **soq** will look at the correct »part« of the serial
uakci (2022-01-09T14:53:06.459Z): yet another way to look at it: in an adjectival serial such as A B, the A part is qualitative (how *much* something is A), whereas the B part is quantitative (*if* that thing is B *at all*). so rather than A × B we have something like the *truth value* of B times the *extent* of Aa
uakci (2022-01-09T14:53:29.079Z): if you agree with these postulates, you'll find this definition of **soq** unobjectionable
uakci (2022-01-09T19:37:09.791Z): CORRECTION: the example beginning in **nı sỏq chủı…** should read **gu sỏq chủı…** instead

uakci (2023-01-21T00:15:48.288Z): extending hoemaı's analysis of english focus adverbs such as 'only' and 'even', which actually pair with sentence-level stress-based focus, we can see that 'the most' works similarly: '*I* like apples the most' (more than other people) vs. 'I like *apples* the most' (more than I do other fruit/food). **soq** used to be really inconvenient in convoluted situations and usually required a confusing **lu** clause to work at all, whereas this approach should feel much more natural

▯ is a member of the superorder Dinosauria (the true dinosaurs).
Hoemai (2019-04-01T23:09:13.000Z): "Dinosaur" is from Ancient Greek δεινός (“terrible, fearful”) + σαῦρος (“lizard”), which is an alternative form of σαύρᾱ. δεινός (from PIE *dwey- (“fear”)) sounds like and is close in meaning to **tea**, while **saorā** sounds like σαύρᾱ but also happens to includes **sao**, which means "large", which is very fitting for dinosaurs. This compound is thus a lucky coincidence on two levels.

I'm happy that you're here.
robintown (2023-10-30T00:16:31.940Z): Lynn and I had a discussion about this, where we concluded that neither **kûı** or **gêm** really make sense for this meaning. As adjuncts, both constructions imply that you are, on the whole, happy. But imagine a situation in which you're having a bad day, and a friend comes to comfort you: you might say "I'm happy that you're here" even if it wouldn't be genuine to say "I'm happy". We found a paper https://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/DIzYWZkM/clauses.doc which claims that the clausal constituent participates in the semantics by a "regarding" relation, which suggests that a topic is the appropriate construction in Toaq. And there's similar evidence in Japanese to support this.

Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:45:29.960Z): I think the ^ tone semantics assume ë instead of ꝡä
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:45:49.259Z): But I think it's fine to allow for ꝡä
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:46:05.012Z): Probably depending on the type of the verb on which ^ is put
kazoo (2025-11-09T18:46:18.771Z): makes sense
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:47:34.930Z): The ꝡä semantics are needed for using stuff like ⟪guo⟫ and ⟪le⟫ as adverbs
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:47:51.628Z): And I even suspect this also applies to stuff like ⟪ca⟫ and ⟪rao⟫
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:48:40.306Z): Alternatively, it could be that the meaning of “event” is more abstract that what I supposed thus far, in such a way that the ë-ꝡä distinction wouldn't really be meaningful…
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:49:42.974Z): Besides Matrix, we could also use GitHub Discussion (i.e. GitHub forums)
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:49:59.587Z): Any repository can have a GitHub Discussion attached to it
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:50:30.395Z): I don't know whether the GitHub notification bot that relays Issues message would also relay stuff from Discussions
Ilmen (2025-11-09T18:52:56.526Z): Oh there's also the Conlangs From Space forum
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:01:22.665Z): iirc wä is a subset of ë where the speaker also claims the event happened. am i recalling correctly?
evie (2025-11-09T19:01:38.089Z): no
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:01:58.929Z): also i wonder if shu includes the tone or does it just quote the root
evie (2025-11-09T19:02:00.015Z): wa is 'the (fact/proposition/statement) that'
evie (2025-11-09T19:03:01.171Z): shu does not steal tone. shu rao, shu jí, shu wä, shu nîe
evie (2025-11-09T19:04:36.286Z): shú whatever / ké shu whatever turns it into a noun
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:05:03.847Z): i know but i mean is shú rao the same as shú ráo
evie (2025-11-09T19:06:14.689Z): no
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:07:43.203Z): then what is the fundamental difference between an event of... and a fact of...
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:08:02.389Z): (unrelated to shu)
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:10:44.714Z): A proposition is abstract, it contains only the information that is given in it and nothing more; a proposition can entail any less detailed version of it (“a tall man wears a blue hat” → “a man wears a hat”), and any more detailed proposition similarly entails the first one, forming a hierarchy of level of detailedness / amount of information.
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:11:50.156Z): The way I understand events is that they are individual entities, presumably spatiotemporal entities but I think it's possible to extend them to non-spationtempral worlds (so that “an event of 1 = √1” would make sense)
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:12:53.635Z): It is possible to conceive individuals and propositions as belonging to a single supertype, in such a way that an individual is an infinitely or maximally detailed proposition, so that, unlike standard proposition, an event cannot entail or be instantiated by a “more detailed event”
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:13:15.715Z): So that it would be like a terminal node in the hierarchy of abstractness/detailedness
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:14:03.369Z): 
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:14:09.145Z): 
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:14:21.436Z): i keep hitting the enter button
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:14:27.825Z): As a side note, ⟪ꝡä⟫ and ⟪báq ë⟫ could possibly be equivalent in effect
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:14:50.756Z): :thinking emoji:
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:15:16.105Z): But I'm not sure, the semantics of ⟪báq⟫ seem to have changed in Kúna, and I've not yet studied new-báq…
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:18:40.933Z): Anyway, people say that tone ^ is associated with events, but this might clash with my theory of “events are indiviuals reifying propositions”
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:19:59.740Z): I've started to doubt that verbs like ⟦ca⟧ deal with individual events instead of propositions
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:20:50.337Z): When you say ⟪pushing this button causes the door to open⟫, you're not thinking of a specific fully detailed and concrete event of pushing the button
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:21:14.029Z): If you did, we wouldn't know whether the real cause would be unspoken details about the event
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:21:38.002Z): But with an adverb like ⟪de⟫, you do want to talk about unspoken details
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:22:07.846Z): ⟪he danced funnily⟫ means that some unspoken details of a concrete event instantiating ⟪he dances⟫ are funny
evie (2025-11-09T19:22:09.559Z): yea i think shê works better there. shê wá someone pushes the button nä the door opens
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:22:22.378Z): it's not just the abstract idea that he dances that is funny
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:22:54.199Z): Maybe we could also say that ⟪dê⟫ is actually not good and that we should use ⟪châ sá de⟫
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:23:16.272Z): Or we could say that ⟪de⟫'s type require an individual, concrete reading, unlike e.g. ⟪ca⟫
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:23:27.275Z): *requires
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:25:31.261Z): It's not just ⟪ca⟫, imagine also ⟪boq⟫
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:26:08.388Z): I suspect more predicates that we might expect actually expect abstract, non-concrete events (i.e. propositions)
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:27:48.890Z): i wonder what the wa - wä pair for ë would even be
evie (2025-11-09T19:28:13.601Z): e is hardly ever used as the main verb of a sentence
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:28:20.026Z): or if it would even make sense
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:29:54.033Z): Well, speech acts are typically about ꝡä or embedded questions, not about concrete event arguments
Ilmen (2025-11-09T19:30:58.838Z): Oh I tend to forget ⟪é⟫ isn't a (regular) complementizer like ꝡa
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:35:06.027Z): unrelatedly, ive been working on a new language whose grammar could be considered improved toaq gamma with a hint of delta proposals
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:36:07.238Z): a lot of my langs lately have been coincidentally similar to toaq so i've decided to embrace the toaqness now
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:41:03.826Z): it takes some surface-level inspiration with other sinitic languages with its phonology
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:46:46.900Z): it only has ë and lä clauses as complementizers and the other clause "type"s are constructed by just attaching it to a noun as a plain ol ~adjective
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:47:24.361Z): so that it can be more flexible
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:47:46.642Z): (c.f. 300 different NU particles of lojban)
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:52:11.795Z): it tries to bring the "everything is a predicate" even further
kazoo (2025-11-09T19:56:02.556Z): compared to toaq im planning to make it basically like loglan vs lojban except its a coexisting fun alternative rather than an improvement
kazoo (2025-11-09T20:06:08.217Z): i think toaq as it is is already cool, i just like to make stuff that would keep the level of coolness
kazoo (2025-11-09T20:09:46.448Z): it also primarily switches to monadic second-(/higher?-)order logic which is expressively the same as plural logic but uses sets which is more intuitive to me
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:11:13.766Z): Nothing wrong with making new Toaq-inspired languages :')
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:11:43.148Z): You can have modified sets… You probably don't want empty sets in the way, do you?
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:12:00.235Z): On the other hand, nested sets may be useful
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:15:20.432Z): Some forms of Plural Logic allows for nested plurals, but with important constrants
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:15:50.807Z): E.g. you can have the equivalent of {{A, B}, {C, D}}, but not {{A, B}, C, D}
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:16:20.034Z): And the former is not of the same type as {A, B}
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:16:38.999Z): (first-order plural vs second-order plural, basically)
kazoo (2025-11-09T20:37:39.174Z): i see
kazoo (2025-11-09T20:51:31.505Z): i also briefly considered abolishing the universal quantifier by using a special object incorporation construction, basically resulting as "there is a set that has an instance of all humans; which satisfies aliveness"
kazoo (2025-11-09T20:51:55.917Z): but i do not know if this would work for all instances of universal quantification
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:54:29.753Z): With empty sets allowed, and saying that each member of the set individually has the property, then it works for a singular universal quantifier
Ilmen (2025-11-09T20:55:10.708Z): Eberban doesn't have quantifiers and use predicates instead
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:06:58.670Z): yeah im just gonna make it sá by default and make the rest with predicates
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:09:28.818Z): i decided that because i randomly remembered once that the wiki says to append shı to the argument to mimic singularity and i thought "why is this not made for every determiner??"
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:21:32.369Z): There used to be ⟪túshı⟫ at one point in the past
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:22:16.897Z): But it was decided that it was more frequently used than plural universal, so ⟪túshı⟫'s meaning was transposed over ⟪tú⟫
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:24:57.688Z): thats a little bit funny lol, the newer concept being swapped with the normal one
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:26:46.621Z): tho i meant that every determiner should instead be a predicate
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:27:51.145Z): Have you looked into my Yaıgawe? All quantifiers are derived from verbs with a “quantifierizer” suffix.
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:28:30.436Z): Nahaıwa can do that too, but it has morphological shorthand for some common determiners
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:29:44.993Z): As for what is the unmarked default quantifier for them… Originally my idea was that the default would be lowest-scope existential quantification, but now I'm considering the possibility to have the default be a báq-like intension (i.e. not necessarily referring to a concrete individual)
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:33:28.092Z): So that ⟪beautiful-V dog-NOM⟫ would mean ⟪dogness is beautiful⟫ rather than ⟪there exist a beautiful dog⟫
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:35:08.902Z): Hmm maybe this should depend on modality too
Ilmen (2025-11-09T21:36:30.904Z): Oh, don't forget the anaphoric determiner, Toaq's raising tone, which can't quite be rendered as a predicate
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:38:56.371Z): hm, maybe i could handle it by just offering hu/ke options or using back-referring pronouns
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:40:21.050Z): if i (la'anai) manage to not use up most of the tones i have added to the phonology i could use one for that
kazoo (2025-11-09T21:42:07.163Z): currently have like 6 or 7 of them
